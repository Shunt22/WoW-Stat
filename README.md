# Installation and Usage
To use this source code you MUST have Blizzard API key. You can get it for free on here: https://dev.battle.net/.
Once you have it, you should create file named "CONFIG" and put the key there. See CONFIG.example.
Then, you should put this file in the jbossews directory on the Openshift or in the root directory of your project, if you host it somewhere else.

This code will NOT work with out API key. Make sure you have one.
